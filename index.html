                                My journey began on the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a>
                                in Indonesia, living there for seven years before moving to the United States in 2006.
                                The western world is a very different frontier in more ways than one. Before learning
                                languages such as C++ and Java to command computer programs, I first had to learn to
                                speak English to communicate to the people in this new land. But perhaps the biggest
                                change I encountered was the shift in technology. In this world, everyone seemed to have
                                comforts such as central air conditioning and flat screen television. I went from having
                                dial-up internet to stable Wi-Fi connection and quickly became immersed in the
                                cybersphere. I remembered how daunting it was at first to navigate the internet just to
                                contact my family back in Asia, but soon using the computer became second nature to me.
                                I would spend hours upon hours connecting with people online, playing games, watching
                                videos, and listening to music. Spotify is among my favorite and most used applications
                                and it inspired me to pursue a minor in Statistics to go along with a BS in Computer
                                Science as they showed me how powerful analysis of <a
                                    href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/big-data/">big data</a> can be through
                                their remarkable song recommendation algorithm <a
                                    href="https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/how-spotify-uses-machine-learning-models">(and
                                    their many other features)</a>. Each week I sift through to the tunes personally
                                suggested to me and more often than not I find something new that interests me.<br><br>

                                As one might guess, my biggest interest outside of computer science is music. I dabble
                                in songwriting and love playing the flute. (I also own a piano, a guitar, and a violin
                                but I have not been able to master those instruments, not for lack of trying.) When I am
                                not searching for new music on Spotify or aspiring to become a musician I am often found
                                supporting Manchester United in soccer, Scuderia Ferrari in Formula One racing, or
                                Houston sports teams in whichever sports they play. In my free time, I enjoy watching
                                streams on Twitch both as a form of entertainment and as a tool to help me improve in
                                games such as chess and Overwatch. Photography is also another big hobby of mine and I
                                have traveled to all 50 states (as well as a few places internationally) in search of
                                beautiful places to capture images of. Among the places I have been to, I hope to be
                                able to revisit Canada and New Zealand. And of course, Java.</p>
